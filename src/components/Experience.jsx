    <p>I started my career as the MD of this institute in July 2019. 
                With no prior knowledge fo the industry, i took up the challenge of managing 
                this institute with a workforce of 10-12 and an yearly student enrollment of
                around 200 trainees. A thin, young, urban boy like me should have been a wrong
                fit for the job but I fit in just fine. Apparently, rural life resonated with me.
                As the MD, over the period of these four years, I have faced many problems and 
                challenges (including the juggernaut COVID-19) but I tried to remain calm and 
                find solutions to all the problems. With my mother, father and wife supporting me 
                always, in 2019 only I thought of starting my own cloud kitchen from home to
                convert my hobbie of cooking into a career.</p>
                <h4> The Chicken Grill</h4>
        
        <p>As I was growing up, I had developed a hobbie of cooking. I tried to improve it 
            and also create my own new recipies with time. As I was looking to start some new
            venture in 2019, it struck my mind to start a cloud kitchen from my home. With a 
            few renovations to a shed on the rooftop, I started my first new venture of 
            The Chicken Grill.</p>

        <p>Opened in the November month of 2019, I had to shut my business down 
            because of the onset of the pandemic and lockdown in the country in 
            the month of March 2020. During its short run, I got some good (a few bad) reviews
            and got many repeat customers. As the pandemic and the lockdown conditions continued
            for 1.5-2 years in the country, I planned to wrap it up completely with no 
            intention to start it again for sometime now.</p>
                
        <h4>Pathmakers IELTS Centre</h4>
        
        <p>After the situation normalized a bit after the pandemic, I along with my mother, 
            started another venture. It was an IELTS coaching centre named Pathmakers IELTS Coaching 
            Centre in Kot fatuhi, a small village in the Hoshiarpur district. </p>

        <p>After a sucessfull year of running the centre, unfortunately due to some logistic
           issues me and my mother decided to shut it down. We were able to reach breakeven
           in the business and even after 2 years of closing the centre, our alumini still call 
           call us to resume the centre. Our overall sucess rate in terms of students getting
           the desired result was more than 80% and we are proud of it. </p>
