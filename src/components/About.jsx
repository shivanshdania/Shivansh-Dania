        <p>I am Shivansh Dania. I am starting 
            my journey as a Web Developer. Currently 
            living in my hometown, Jalandhar, I am working as 
            the Managing Director of an Industrial Training Institute, Kalgidhar ITI,
            in Mahilpur, Distt. Hoshiarpur<a href="http://kalgidhariti.com/"
             target= "blank">(Visit institute website).</a> Though the job that I am currently doing is very fulfilling, I want
            to explore and excel the web developer role and thus I decided to 
            upskill myself to enter the corporate world.</p>
